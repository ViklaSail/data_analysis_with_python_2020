    "The [TMC extension for VS Code](https://github.com/rage/tmc-vscode) is new and may contain bugs. That said, it does seem to work well and is significantly more approachable than the TMC CLI. Below is a very short point-to-point guide for setup. Visit the linked page for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Install `VS Code` in the home tab on anaconda navigator\n",

    "* Under the `Extensions` tab on the left (Four squares), look for `TestMyCode` *MOOC.fi â€“ University of Helsinki*\n",
    "* Install the Extension\n",
    "* You will see a new `TMC` tab int the left section of VS Code. \n",
    "* Follow the directions to log in and select the correct course.\n",
    "* After selectin the course, it is added to your courses in VS Code, After this you can access a \"course page\" in VS Code to download exercises\n",
    "* Now you can access the exercises by clicking `Open exercise workspace`.\n",
    "* As you complete exercises you can run tests locally by clicking the `TMC - run tests` button on the top right.\n",
    "* After passing the local test, you can submit to server from the test results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative approach (TMC CLI)\n",
    "\n",
    "* TMC requires a fairly modern java 8 or later to work properly.\n",
    "    * open jdk 1.8.0_212 for example works\n",
    "    * as do all 11.x and 12.x versions i've seen.\n",
    "    * you can try to install and run tmc and update your java install if logging in with the cli fails.\n",
    "* Follow the instructions on the following page to install TMC client \n",
    "    https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-cli\n",
    "* Note that on this course we use the command line version of TMC, not netbeans or any other IDE. So, you need to know the basics of command line use in the terminal/command prompt\n",
    "* Go to a folder where you want to download the exercises, and issue command `tmc login`\n",
    "* If it asks for a server address, then your TMC client is outdated. Re-install the client. Note, that the installation script was updated very recently (12.3.2019). So, if you had problems with it, you might want to try again.\n",
    "* Provide login details, and use organization slug `hy`\n",
    "* Then issue command `tmc download hy-data-analysis-with-python-spring-2020` to download the exercises\n",
    "* Important commands:\n",
    "  * `tmc` to show help message\n",
    "  * `tmc test` to test your solution locally\n",
    "  * `tmc submit` to submit your solution to the server for grading\n",
    "* The above github page of the tmc-client also contains instructions on the use of the client"
